    <h1>Time Adventure</h1>
   
   
    <p><strong>Time passes, people grow, and they come and go. <br> Things change and yet nothing is different from it's origin.</strong></p>
    <p>Seeds planted at the start,<br> they cycle through, and live. <br>But no matter how they <em>grow</em> or how much they <strong>grow,</strong> <br>they are still the same little seed that was taken care of and is well nourished.</p>
    <p>Only that new perspectvies were placed, <br> was when change was taking form.</p>
    <p>Wheather that's the seed's persepective of the world around it,</p>
    <p>or the nourisher's view of it's seed,</p>
    <p><strong><em>Everything stays, but still changes.</em></strong></p>
